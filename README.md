## 🥎 About

This project contains my set of templates which I spawn with [`newpy`](https://github.com/blankRiot96/newpy)

## 📝 Templates

all my templates by default use a line length of 88 everywhere

### pg

- `pg` is the template which I use when starting a generic pygame project which is to be pushed to GitHub

### pg-basic

- just contains a standard pygame mainloop, nothing more
